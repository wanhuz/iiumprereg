# IIUM Pre-Registration Utility

Automatically register subject for IIUM university subject. Input the course code + section and click start. 
It will run at 12am the next day.

This program works, but the prereg website has bad coding that the program cannot account for:
  1. Server crash when registration open. Thus the program cannot register at 12am.
  2. Weird website coding changes over new semester.

A better advice is to brute force subject registration by using browser and fast internet. But IIUM server will probably crash and you might need to wait until 3am so yeah..
